# NearOracle :ringed_planet: : Credit Scoring on NEAR Protocol üîÆ  

![primary-banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82831286/185993806-279822d0-ffc5-4b7b-91d9-55ce7f4fbd60.png)

### Overview

NearOracle is an oracle for credit scoring that runs on the NEAR protocol and serves web3 users interested in lending or borrowing money in the crypto space. The dApp has been developed by BalloonBox through a grant by the [NEAR Foundation](https://near.foundation/). The dapp retrieves the user's fiat or crypto financial history from three validators (Plaid, Coinbase, MetaMask) and uses it to calculate a numerical score, namely an integer representing a user's financial health. Ranking users through a credit score is essential to distinguish between trusted and suspicious agents in the web3 space. The dApp caters to a specific use case, namely unsecured P2P lending: facilitating lending and borrowing of crypto loans.

###### How does the dApp work?

- It acquires user's financial data by integrating with three validators ([Plaid](https://dashboard.plaid.com/overview), [Coinbase](https://developers.coinbase.com/), and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/))
- It runs the credit scoring algorithm to compute a score assessing a user's financial health
- It writes the score to the blockchain via a Wasm smart contract build using the Rust `NEAR SDK`

###### In this Repo

This is the client side repo for NearOracle, made with the developer experience in mind: Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Lint-Staged, VSCode, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS. The dApp fetches the user's financial history, passes it to the algorithm, (see the codebase of the NearOracle credit score algorithm at [`near-oracle-algorithm`](https://github.com/BalloonBox-Inc/near-oracle-algorithm)),which executes and returns a score via a Rust smart contract (see codebase at [`near-oracle-contract`](https://github.com/BalloonBox-Inc/near-oracle-contract)).

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm or yarn

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```
git clone  ... my-project-name
cd my-project-name
git checkout develop
yarn install
```

### Credentials Required

You will need the credentials & accounts listed below to get started:

1. NEAR Wallet account ([testnet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/) or [mainnet](https://wallet.near.org/))
2. API keys and credentials from data providers

  - CoinMarketCap API key &#8594; follow the Developers guide [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Introduction)
  - Plaid client_id and secret_key &#8594; create a Plaid account [here](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signin), then retrieve your Plaid [keys] (https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/keys)
  - Coinbase API Key &#8594; create a Coinbase account [here](https://www.coinbase.com/signup), then retrieve your Coinbase [keys](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api) </br>
  To generate a new set of API keys follow this flow: `Coinbase` -> `settings` -> `API` -> `New API Key`.
  - Covalent API key &#8594; register [here](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/#/auth/register/)
  
3. NFT.Storage API key where you can upload off-chain NFT data for free. ‚Üí register [here](https://nft.storage/)
4. NEAR wallet account id where your contracts have been deployed




Create a .env.local file in your root folder:

```bash

NEXT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

COINBASE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_Id
COINBASE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
COINBASE_AUTHORIZE_URL=https://www.coinbase.com/oauth/authorize
COINBASE_TOKEN_URL=https://api.coinbase.com/oauth/token

PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PLAID_URL_SANDBOX=sandbox.plaid.com
PLAID_SECRET_KEY_SANDBOX=your_sandbox_key

BACKEND_BASE_URL=https://dev-near-oracle-backend.herokuapp.com
COINMARKET_KEY=your_coinmarketcapapikey

COVALENT_KEY=your_covalent_api_key

NFT_STORAGE_KEY=your_nft_storage_key

CONTRACT_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY=private_key_of_the_contract_owner
SCORE_CONTRACT_NAME=name_of_the_contract_for_storing_a_score
NFT_CONTRACT_NAME=name_of_the_contract_for_minting_an_NFT

ENV_CONFIG=testnet | mainnet


```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload. Ensure you run this command after `cd` into the local folder where you cloned the repo.
